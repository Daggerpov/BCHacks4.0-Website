## Brainstorming Route We Took:

- firstly, we thought of pulling up articles while someone writes their essay to do research for them
  - this expanded to having an integrated plagiarism checker
  - then, we thought of having an extension for this
- thinking of how we can incorporate our (albeit limited) knowledge of data science from DATA 101 into keeping track of metrics when students wrote their essay for motivation 
  - we were thinking of telling them about when they've been slowing down, or reminding them to take coffee breaks
    - then, this went into thinking about the time spent writing a particular assignment and comparing that with other users
- users could be compared to encourage, or have them realize how realistic an expectation they have is for doing a certain assignment with a given time
- Then, we expanded from just thinking about english essay writing, to solving mathematics problems by accessing online tools such as Desmos automatically
  - We then figured that **the purpose of this is to automate the usual workflow of a user doing their work for certain subjects** (such as them normally checking for plagiarism in an essay, or referencing a graph of a function, or looking up the answer, of course. 

# Next.js included things:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
